Challenge 3 Screenshot of work process:

For this branch, I've added a code on VS  that should deploy to the web browser.

I've also embedded the images from the images folder for convenience so that I could list the right images in the actual code when inserted into the tags.

I have two html files, one leading to another page from the original and one CSS stylesheet.

Web users are to press the "Sign Up" button with a hovering icon to be transported to the next page. The "Contact Us" button does the same command.

The styles, font and images are different on each page to reflect a variety of style and skill for this challenge.
